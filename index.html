   The lines above are creepy hack, easpcially the suppid assign, TO understand
     <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/>

     Inside Jekyll, a file and a data can be accessed via x.y.z
     However, for a dir, the direct access become objects that hold info about each files.

     [0] -> filename, [1] -> THE FIST PART OF THE FILE (before `---` in YAML's synatx).

     Then, AMAZINGLY, the second part is Inaccessible ???? There is no www[2] Since 10 years ago.

     They are super lazy, and only process first part of the file as a normal post page for a data file???

     You may test by directly out put www[1] and www[0].
